# Visualizing-the-digits-of-pi
1. We use the decimal system (10), so we divide the circle in 10 parts, each one of which is 36 degrees (360 / 10 = 36).
2. We map each decimal digit to an angle according to the following rule: digit = n ---> angle = n * 36, so the digit 3 is mapped in 108 degrees.
3. We scan pi's digits to find the angles and after that we use turtle to visualize this
4. For every digit we walk 10 units forward and turn left n * 36 degrees.
